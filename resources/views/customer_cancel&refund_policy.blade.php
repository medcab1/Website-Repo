                Cancellations can be frustrating  for riders and driver partners alike, which is why the cancellation fee is in place to ensure that drivers are fairly compensated for their time when committing to a trip.                <br/>

                In the event of circumstances beyond our control, Med Cab reserves the right to cancel all services. Where payment has been made, a refund will be issued. If a Ambulance breaks down during the journey, an alternative will be provided with a practical time allowance.
                
                <br/>
                <br/>
                All cancellations of local journeys made before the booking time and prior to vehicle dispatch will not incur a penalty charge.
            
                If you cancel within 5 minutes: You will not be charged a cancellation fee.
                
                If you cancel after 5 minutes: The cancellation fee for a canceled trip will automatically be charged to your next trip.
            
                Before you cancel a trip, you will receive a notification to ensure that you are aware of the fee that will be deducted from your wallet.
                
                No refunds will be given for journeys terminated part way.
                
                If you have canceled multiple trips consecutively, the cancellation fees for the multiple trips will accumulate as arrears and prevent any more requests from going through. In such cases, you’re expected to clear the arrears using an alternative payment method, such as a credit, debit Ambulances, etc. Once the payments in arrears have been cleared, you will be able to request an Med Cab as usual.
